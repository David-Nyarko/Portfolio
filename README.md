# Virginia Runaway Slave Records
- **Description**: This project involves a comprehensive analysis and visualization of runaway slave records from Virginia between 1820 and 1860. Utilizing data from the Virginia government dataset, the visualizations reveal patterns and trends in escape incidents across different counties and highlight specific enslavers with the highest numbers of recorded escapes. The project aims to provide a deeper historical understanding of the dynamics of escapes and the implications on both the local and broader scales.

 # Analyzing the Financial Playbook of Collegiate Athletics
- **Description**: This project delves into the financial intricacies of collegiate athletics in the U.S. from 2010 to 2014, focusing on subsidies, athletic expenses, endowments, and NCAA distributions. By analyzing data across various university divisions and conferences, it highlights the financial disparities between "power-five" conferences and smaller, less sports-focused schools. The visualizations illustrate how reliance on donor support versus government subsidies varies significantly, suggesting potential areas for reevaluating NCAA funding distribution to balance the playing field across all athletic programs.

# Visualizing Energy Grids and State Data
- **Description**: This project showcases the power of geospatial visualization by integrating state-level geojson data with energy grid information to produce several types of maps. Using Vega-Lite API, the visualizations include a geoshape representation of U.S. states, a point map, and a symbol map of energy grid vertices, each linked to the corresponding voltage data. Additionally, a choropleth map highlights differences in state areas. The layered maps provide insights into how energy infrastructure intersects with geographical boundaries, demonstrating potential areas for further analysis in energy distribution and state demographics.
